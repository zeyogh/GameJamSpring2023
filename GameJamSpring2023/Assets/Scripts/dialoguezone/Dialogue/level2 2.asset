  - MORTALS.
  - ACROSS TIME AND SPACE, OUR FORM HAS BEEN SUMMONED TO APPEAR BEFORE YOU.
  - WE HAVE WITNESSED BEINGS LIKE YOU. FROM OTHER WORLDS.
  - THEY WIELDED THE MIGHT OF THE COSMOS. MACHINES THAT BLOTTED OUT THE STARS THEMSELVES,
    FORGED AGAINST OUR COLLECTIVE.
  - THEY WERE MIGHTY. THEY WERE FELLED. THEY BEGGED FOR ABSOLUTION BEFORE THE END.
